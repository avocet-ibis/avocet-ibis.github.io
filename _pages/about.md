## About
Howdy! I am a naturalist based in Grand Lake, CO. I spend most of my free time exploring the Intermountain West and familiarizng myself with the local floral and fauna. My academic background is in planetary science and hydrology, but I have a strong interest in landscape and wetland ecology. This blog is mostly an exercise in writing and a way to document the things I wander upon. 

Feel free to check out my [eBird](https://ebird.org/profile/MzY3MzY2MA) and [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&user_id=spencer3616&verifiable=any) observations. If you can come up with a good reason to reach out, my email is [sahurt@pm.me](mailto:sahurt@pm.me)!
