## About
Howdy! I am a naturalist currently based in Grand Lake, CO, with a strong interest in landscape and stream ecology. I spend most of my free time exploring the Intermountain West, familiarizing myself with the local flora, fauna, and geology. This blog is mostly an exercise in writing, but also a way to document what I wander upon.

Feel free to check out my [eBird](https://ebird.org/profile/MzY3MzY2MA) and [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&user_id=spencer3616&verifiable=any) observations! Some of of my better photos can be found here [here](/photos/). If you can imagine a good reason to reach out, my email is [sahurt@pm.me](mailto:sahurt@pm.me).
