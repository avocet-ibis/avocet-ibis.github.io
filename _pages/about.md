## About
Howdy! I am a naturalist currently based in Grand Lake, CO. I spend most of my free time exploring the Intermountain West, familiarizing myself with the local flora and fauna. This blog is mostly an exercise in writing, but also a way to document what I wonder upon.

Feel free to check out my [eBird](https://ebird.org/profile/MzY3MzY2MA) and [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&user_id=spencer3616&verifiable=any) observations. If you can contemplate a good reason to reach out, my email is [sahurt@pm.me](mailto:sahurt@pm.me)!
